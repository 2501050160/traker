# Media Assets

Add your video assets here for the login experience:

1. `intro-animation.mp4` – short 5-second animation shown on page load.
2. `background-loop.mp4` – looping background video that plays behind the login form after the intro completes.

Make sure both files are optimized for the web (muted, compressed, and under a few megabytes) to keep the login page responsive.
